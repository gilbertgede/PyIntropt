(What started out as:)
A Python Interior Point Optimization Solver

Originally, another nonlinear interior-point trust region solver, based on the
NITRO (Nonlinear Interior point Trust Region Optimizer) algorithm developed by
Byrd et al. [Byrd1999].

The robustness of this implementation of the NITRO algorithm against the CUTEr
[Gould2005] test suite, as compared to published results [Byrd1999] did not
seem favourable. As such, the interior point algorithm isn't being worked on
currently.

The NLP active set method described by Betts [Betts2010] is instead being
implemented. It appears more appropriate for optimal control problems, and its
core is a quadratic programming (QP) solver, which is easier to test in
isolation.
